# Tamanotchi *WIP*

To install dependancies:
```
$ npm install
```

To start the server:
```
$ node .
```

And then open up a browser and go to <http://localhost:6969/> to view the app.

I think that's how npm works at least, haven't tested that yet.

I don't own any of the Tamagotchi assets and do not profit off any of this.
It's just for nostalgia.
